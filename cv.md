## CODE EXAMPLES
The example implements conversion between distance units with support for metric and imperial systems of measures. By default there are rules for conversion: meters (m), centimeters (cm), inches (in) and feet (ft), and support conversion between any units. Conversion rules are stored in JSON in the form:
```
{`${name unit}`: equivalent,...}
```
It is also possible to expand the list of supported units. As an example, the code adds yard."yard" is added as an example. The input data is sent as JSON file, then it is checked using a regular expression and according to the available units. Example of input data format:
```
[{"distance": {"unit": "km", "value": 1}, "convert_to": "m"},...]
```
### Example
```
(async  function () {
	//loading dada about units from jsons file
	let  units  =  await  fetch('./assets/data/units.json');
	let  json  =  await  fetch('./assets/data/data.json')
	units  =  await  units.json();
	json  =  await  json.json();
	console.log(units,json);

	//Add new unit
	addUnit(units,"yd",91.44)

	//Regular expression
	let  chek  = /(\{"distance":\{"unit":"\w*"\,"value":\d*\}\,"convert_to":"\w*"\})/gm
	json  =  JSON.stringify(json)
	json  =  json.match(chek);
	console.log(json);

	//Create array for answers
	let  featback  =  new  Array();
	for (let  item  of  json) {
		item  =  JSON.parse(item);
		if (!(`${item.distance.unit}`  in  units  ||  !`${item.convert_to}`  in  units) ||  typeof(+item.distance.value) !=  'number') {
			console.log(`this no right`,item);
			continue;
		}

		let  value  =  item.distance.value;
		let  equvivalentFromUnit  =  units[item.distance.unit];
		let  equvalentToUnit  =  units[item.convert_to];

		value  = (equvivalentFromUnit  *  value) /  equvalentToUnit;

		featback.push({
			'unit':  item.convert_to,
			'value':  +value.toFixed(2)
		})

	}

	featback  =  JSON.stringify(featback);
	console.log(featback);
}())
```
